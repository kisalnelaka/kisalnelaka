<br />

I’ve spent **8+ years** writing code and I still don't know why I do this to myself. I have the attention span of a goldfish and enough caffeine in my system to kill a horse. I build systems that are smarter than me because honestly, that’s not a high bar.

I write **PHP** and **Laravel** because I hate my life. I have a **Cybersecurity Degree** and extensive history with the "dark arts" (red teaming, blackhat stuff I won't put on LinkedIn), but I'm not a "Cybersecurity Professional" because I hate writing reports. I just build tools that make security engineers sweat. 

If you see me zoning out, I'm probably dissociating or wondering if a hotdog is a sandwich.

### stuff i use to pretend i'm working

- **Languages**: PHP (gross, I know), Python (for hacking things), JavaScript (for pain), Dart, C++, SQL.
- **Frameworks**: Laravel (my toxic trait), Filament, React, Vue, Flutter, Qt.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (it works on my machine), Linux (because Windows is for noobs).
- **Security**: I have the degree and the tools. I know things I shouldn't.

### things i made instead of going to therapy

#### [TenancyOS](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/TenancyOS)
**Enterprise Property Management SaaS**
A production-ready, multi-tenant platform built with **Laravel 11 and React**. It handles automated organization scoping, RBAC, and full audit logging because managing properties manually is for suckers and I like my data organized.

#### [Verdict](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/verdict)
**Engineering Governance Infrastructure**
I treated decisions as first-class primitives with immutable accountability. It's rule-based autopsy for when things inevitably catch fire. It's not just task tracking; it's a way to ensure we know exactly who to blame (usually me).

#### [IntraFlow](https://github.com/kisalnelaka)
**SaaS/MSP/MSSP Operations Platform**
A massive thing to run telecom and security companies. I could probably shut them all down with one button but I need money for chicken nuggets. It manages inventory, billing, and security so I don't have to talk to humans.

#### [Bunny](https://github.com/socialrabbit/bunny)
**Laravel Scaffolding Framework**
I got tired of boilerplate, so I wrote a production-ready framework that generates fully functional backends faster than I can make instant noodles. It’s now equipped with sophisticated CLI commands to scaffold entire CMS modules. Efficiency is just laziness with extra steps.

#### [ASAN (Adaptive Symmetry-Aware Network)](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/ASAN)
**AI & Deep Learning**
I taught a computer to do chemistry because biology was too hard. It predicts molecule properties using symmetry-aware networks. I don't remember the math anymore but the loss curves were beautiful. Science!

#### [FocusFlow-Hub](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/FocusFlow-Hub)
**ADHD Management SaaS**
Built using **TypeScript** because my own brain is a browser with 400 tabs open and I don't know where the music is coming from. It tracks habits, focus, and moods to keep me (and hopefully you) from vibrating into another dimension.

#### [BatSignal](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/batsignal)
**Systems Programming & Linux Integration**
My Bluetooth headphones died mid-song and I almost threw them. So I wrote a C++ widget that hacks into DBus to yell at me when the battery is low. Now fully compatible with **KDE Plasma 6** because I refuse to move to Wayland without my battery warnings.

#### [Oha Asa](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/oha_asa_app)
**Cross-Platform Mobile Application**
A Flutter app that tells me my zodiac luck because I need external validation from the stars. It confirms that yes, today is going to be terrible, but it does it with premium widgets.

#### [PhishCatcher](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/phishcatcher)
**Cybersecurity & Machine Learning**
An ML model that lives in your browser and judges every website you visit. It blocks phishing scams because humanity’s greatest weakness is a "Win a free iPhone" link.

#### [Backpacker](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/backpacker)
**Automation & Utilities**
Manual file migration is a war crime. I wrote a Python script to port my browser data because I have commitment issues with operating systems. (I use Arch btw).
