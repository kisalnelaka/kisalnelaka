### Senior Full Stack Developer | I have a Cybersecurity Degree (Don't test me)

<br />

I’ve spent **8+ years** writing code and I still don't know why I do this to myself. I have the attention span of a goldfish and enough caffeine in my system to kill a horse. I build systems that are smarter than me because honestly, that’s not a high bar.

I write **PHP** and **Laravel** because I hate my life. I have a **Cybersecurity Degree** and extensive history with the "dark arts" (red teaming, blackhat stuff I won't put on LinkedIn), but I'm not a "Cybersecurity Professional" because I hate writing reports. I just build tools that make security engineers sweat. 

If you see me zoning out, I'm probably dissociating or wondering if a hotdog is a sandwich.

### stuff i use to pretend i'm working

- **Languages**: PHP (gross, I know), Python (for hacking things), JavaScript (for pain), Dart, C++, SQL.
- **Frameworks**: Laravel (my toxic trait), Filament, React, Vue, Flutter, Qt.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (it works on my machine), Linux (because Windows is for noobs).
- **Security**: I have the degree and the tools. I know things I shouldn't.

### things i made instead of going to therapy

#### [IntraFlow](https://github.com/kisalnelaka)
**Enterprise SaaS/MSP Platform**
I built this massive thing to run telecom companies. I could probably shut them all down with one button but I need money for chicken nuggets. It manages inventory and billing so I don't have to talk to people.

#### [ASAN (Adaptive Symmetry-Aware Network)](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/ASAN)
**AI & Deep Learning**
I got bored and taught a computer to do chemistry. It predicts molecule stuff. I don't even remember how the math works anymore but it looks cool. Science!

#### [Bunny](https://github.com/socialrabbit/bunny)
**Laravel Framework Architecture**
I hate typing the same code twice so I wrote code that writes code. It generates backends faster than I can make instant noodles. Efficiency is just laziness with extra steps.

#### [Oha Asa](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/oha_asa_app)
**Cross-Platform Mobile Application**
A Flutter app that tells me my zodiac luck because I need external validation from the stars. It has widgets. It's premium. It confirms that yes, today is going to be terrible.

#### [BatSignal](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/batsignal)
**Systems Programming & Linux Integration**
My Bluetooth headphones died and I screamed. So I wrote a C++ widget to yell at me when the battery is low. I literally hacked the kernel DBus just so I could listen to music without interruptions.

#### [PhishCatcher](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/phishcatcher)
**Cybersecurity & Machine Learning**
I made an ML model that lives in your browser and judges every website you visit. It blocks phishing scams because y'all will click on anything.

#### [Backpacker](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/backpacker)
**Automation & Utilities**
Manually copying files is for peasants. I wrote a Python script to port my browser data because I have commitment issues with operating systems.
