<br />

I’ve spent the last **8+ years** obsessing over clean architecture, breaking systems just to see how they bleed, and then rebuilding them to be bulletproof. I don’t just "write code"—I engineer digital ecosystems that survive production hell. 

My stack is whatever gets the job done fastest and safest, but I live in **Laravel**, **PHP**, and **Python**. I have a healthy paranoia about security (Digital Forensics degree, sorry), so if your code isn't secure, I *will* judge you.

### The Tech I Abuse Daily

- **Languages**: PHP (yes, it runs the web, deal with it), Python, JavaScript, Dart, C++, SQL.
- **Frameworks**: Laravel (my weapon of choice), Filament, React, Vue, Flutter, Qt.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Linux (where I actually live), CI/CD pipelines that actually pass.
- **Security**: Breaking things, OWASP, Digital Forensics, making sure you don't get hacked.

### The Heavy Artillery

#### [IntraFlow](https://github.com/kisalnelaka)
**Enterprise SaaS/MSP Platform**
I built this beast to handle complex telecom operations so humans don't have to. It's a massive Laravel 11 & Filament v3 system that automates everything from inventory to billing. It’s the kind of system that runs entire companies.

#### [ASAN (Adaptive Symmetry-Aware Network)](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/ASAN)
**AI & Deep Learning**
This is where I get mathematically unhinged. A deep learning architecture I designed for 3D molecular property prediction. It’s neural networks meeting chemistry in a dark alley.

#### [Bunny](https://github.com/socialrabbit/bunny)
**Laravel Framework Architecture**
I got tired of writing the same boilerplate code, so I wrote code that writes code. Bunny generates production-ready backend scaffolding because life is too short for CRUD.

#### [Oha Asa](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/oha_asa_app)
**Cross-Platform Mobile Application**
A Flutter app effectively bringing Japanese "Oha Asa" luck tracking to the west. I reverse-engineered the vibe and built a premium, native-widget-powered experience. It’s polished, it’s automatic, and it looks better than your calendar.

#### [BatSignal](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/batsignal)
**Systems Programming & Linux Integration**
My Bluetooth headphones kept dying and it pissed me off. So I wrote a C++/Qt widget for KDE Plasma to scream at me when my battery is low. Deep DBus integration because I like talking directly to the kernel.

#### [PhishCatcher](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/phishcatcher)
**Cybersecurity & Machine Learning**
I trained an ML model to spot phishing sites faster than you can click "unsubscribe." It runs in real-time inside the browser. It hunts scams so you don't fall for them.

#### [Backpacker](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/backpacker)
**Automation & Utilities**
Moving browser data between Windows and Linux is a nightmare, so I wrote a Python script to automate the pain away. It grabs everything—history, bookmarks, cookies—and ports it over. Pure utility.
