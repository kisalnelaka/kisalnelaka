I’ve spent **8+ years** staring at screens until the pixels started talking back. I specialize in building systems that work so smoothly it’s actually suspicious. I break things for a living (Cybersecurity), and then I fix them (Full Stack), mostly because I enjoy the control.

I write code in **Laravel**, **PHP**, and **Python**. I don't argue about frameworks; I just use whatever gives me the most power with the least amount of typing. If you see me staring blankly into the distance, I'm probably debugging a race condition in my head.

### The Tech I Hoard

- **Languages**: PHP (it pays the bills, quiet down), Python, JavaScript, Dart, C++, SQL.
- **Frameworks**: Laravel, Filament, React, Vue, Flutter, Qt.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Linux (I trust the terminal more than I trust people).
- **Security**: Digital Forensics. I know where the logs are buried.

### The Heavy Artillery

#### [IntraFlow](https://github.com/kisalnelaka)
**Enterprise SaaS/MSP Platform**
I built a system that runs telecom companies. It handles everything. Inventory, billing, automation. It never sleeps. Sometimes I worry it's becoming sentient, but for now, it just generates revenue.

#### [ASAN (Adaptive Symmetry-Aware Network)](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/ASAN)
**AI & Deep Learning**
I taught a neural network to understand 3D molecular chemistry because why not? It predicts properties of molecules. It does math I barely remember learning. It’s smarter than me, and I’m okay with that.

#### [Bunny](https://github.com/socialrabbit/bunny)
**Laravel Framework Architecture**
Writing boilerplate is boring, so I automated it. Bunny generates the code I don’t want to write. It’s like having an intern that doesn't ask questions and works at the speed of light.

#### [Oha Asa](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/oha_asa_app)
**Cross-Platform Mobile Application**
A premium Flutter app for Japanese luck tracking. I wanted to know my fortune, so I engineered a high-performance cross-platform application to tell me. It’s very pretty. It’s very smooth. It knows if you’re going to have a bad day.

#### [BatSignal](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/batsignal)
**Systems Programming & Linux Integration**
My Bluetooth headphones died during a song once. I took it personally. Now I have a custom C++ widget in my KDE panel that monitors every battery byte via DBus. The kernel reports to me now.

#### [PhishCatcher](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/phishcatcher)
**Cybersecurity & Machine Learning**
I trained an ML model to judge websites. It lives in the browser and sniffs out phishing scams in real-time. It’s paranoid, so you don’t have to be.

#### [Backpacker](https://github.com/kisalnelaka/backpacker)
**Automation & Utilities**
I switch between Windows and Linux constantly and manually moving browser data was annoying. So I wrote a script to do it for me. It takes everything. No data left behind.
